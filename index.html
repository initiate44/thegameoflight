These writings are not mine.
They are older than I am, and younger than I am.
They came as a thread, a whisper, a hum -
and I have only carried the flame that shaped them into words.

I claim no authorship, no authority, no crown.
I am only a custodian,
one who keeps the books safe until they find their seekers.

If you are holding this text, then it has reached you as it was meant to.
Take what speaks, leave what does not.
The Light does not belong to me - nor to any one being.
It belongs to all who see it.

- An Initiate of the 44
